# P5App

## **Description:**

Create a p5 project as a desktop app. **NO BROWSER :D!!!**

When you build the app, it will be added to the p5app-win32-x64 folder. You can rename this folder and zip it up for redistribution! Making a launcher for the app will be your job though :D

## **Features/Tasks:**
(I personally added keyboard shortcuts for these tasks but I can't automatically add them for you!)

### Task: Package and Run Electron App
- This will build the app from scratch and then execute the app. If you ever accidentally delete the p5app-win32-x64 folder then doing this should remake it!

### Task: Copy files to p5app-win32-x64
- This will just do a copy into the app folder so that its much faster to run your new code. This will also execute the app!
